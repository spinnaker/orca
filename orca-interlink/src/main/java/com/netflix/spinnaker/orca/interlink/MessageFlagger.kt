/**
 * To avoid pathological cases where 2 orca clusters end up endlessly bouncing the same message back and forth across the
 * interlink, MessageFlagger can act as a circuit breaker. Based on a fixed size evicting queue, it inspects the
 * fingerprint of the last ${maxSize} events published by this instance, and if it detects that we are over some
 * threshold, it will not let the message get published on the topic. One example where this may happen is the following
 * scenario with an orphaned execution that everybody considers as belonging to someone else:
 *
 * 1. execution repo 1 has an execution with id I and partition `apple`
 * 2. execution repo 2 has an execution with the same id I and partition `banana`
 * 3. when a user makes a request to orca 1 with partition `banana` to delete I, it is considered a foreign execution
 *    and a message is sent on the interlink
 * 4. orca 2 receives the interlink message and tries to delete it from execution repo 2, but it is also considered
 *    foreign (because it has partition `apple`)
 * 5. therefore, orca 2 sends a message on the interlink, and so on
 *
 * @param maxSize the maximum number of fingerprints to consider
 * @param threshold a message with fingerprint F will be flagged if the number of times F is present in the queue is
 *    over the threshold
 * @param lookback fingerprints older than the lookback duration will not count toward the threshold
