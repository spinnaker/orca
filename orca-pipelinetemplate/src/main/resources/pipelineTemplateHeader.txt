# The template generated below should be used as a base for further modifications.
# It does not make assumptions as to what things can be made into variables,
# modules, partials or Jinja expressions. This is your responsibility as the owner
# of the template.
#
# Some recommendations to massage the initial output:
#
# * Give your pipeline template a unique ID. It's best to namespace it by your
#   application or team name, so that it does not conflict with other teams,
#   e.g. "myteam-myTemplate".
# * Rename the pipeline stage IDs, notifications and trigger names to be more
#   meaningful. Enumerated stage IDs are ultimately a detriment for long-term
#   maintenance of your template.
# * Best intentions are made to order configuration, but the list of stages
#   themselves are not ordered: Rearrange the stages so that they're roughly
#   chronological.
