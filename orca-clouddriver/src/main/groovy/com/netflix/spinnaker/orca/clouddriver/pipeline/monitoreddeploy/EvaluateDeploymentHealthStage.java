/**
 * NOTE: This stage is part of the monitored deploy strategy
 *
 * <p>This stage is used to consult with the deployment monitor about the state of the deployment.
 * This stage is inserted after each deployment step is completed, e.g. 10%, 50%, 100%. The order of
 * operations is (e.g. for 50%): 1. Enable 50% of traffic to the new ASG 2. Disable 50% of traffic
 * from the old ASG 3. Ask the deployment monitor to evaluate health of newly deployed/enabled
 * instances
 *
 * <p>The deployment monitor can respond with a number of messages including: wait, abort, continue,
 * complete. Based on the response orca will decide how to proceed with the deployment (see
 * readme.md under orca-deploymentmonitor for details on what these mean)
