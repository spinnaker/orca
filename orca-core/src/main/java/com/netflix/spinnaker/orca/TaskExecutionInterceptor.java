/**
 * TaskExecutionInterceptor is a hook point to customize the specific execution of a task.
 *
 * <p>Before execute is called on a Task, all TaskExecutionInterceptors will be called. The
 * resulting Stage object from beforeTaskExecution is passed to subsequent invocations of
 * TaskExecutionInterceptor and then used for the invocation of execute on Task.
 *
 * <p>After a Task completes with a TaskResult, all TaskExecutionInterceptors are called. The
 * resulting TaskResult is passed to subsequent invocations ot TaskExecutionInterceptor and the
 * final TaskResult is used as the output of the task.
 *
 * <p>A TaskExecutionInterceptor can specify the maximum backoff that should be allowed. As an
 * example, the LockExtendingTaskExecutionInterceptor needs to ensure that a task doesn't delay
 * longer than the lock extension. The minimum maxTaskBackoff among all registered
 * TaskExecutionInterceptors will be used to constrain the task backoff supplied by a RetryableTask.
